# OpenCV_Proj1
I am learning OpenCV.  These are some functions I have made while learning OpenCV.
I had to remove the build folder (CMake) because it was over GitHubs 100 file limit.

- HSV Picker gives you sliders, so you can pick your color settings for the next function
- DetectedColor draws when it sees an object of a certain color (virtual marker on a video screen)
- Paper Scanner is like TinyScann.  It warps paper images into a normal rectangle.
- RussianLP detects Russian License Plates and stores them as .png files.
- FaceDetection draws a box around any detected faces.
